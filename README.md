# Kaggle-Housing-Cost-Predictions
My attempt at a Kaggle Project from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. In this project, we are to use some 79 features to predict the final sale price of a house.

## Results
As of 01/22, we've used a Random Forests Classifier. We're switching to Random Forests Regression... because goodness sakes it makes more sense.
